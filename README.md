# Scientific computation

This repository contains the programs that I designed for the Scientific Computation course, at Genomic sciences program. The requirements of each program were the following:

The algorithms use variables with meaningful names, and include comments (internal documentation) that explain the logic used by the program. They also include a short data dictionary describing how each variable is used and what it means. Both documentation and output are in spanish. 

1. This program calculates the root of an equation, using the method of successive approximations.

2. This program calculates the root of an equation, using the Newton-Raphson method.

3. This program calculates the root of an equation, using the Regula-falsi method.

4. This program calculates a functional approximation to the curve followed by certain points provided by the user, using the method of least squares.

5. This program calculates the interpolation of a value given a set of points, or obtain the polynomial of the function that they follow, using the Lagrange Interpolation method.

6. This program solves a system of equations using the Gauss-Seidel method.

7. This program calculates an approximate solution of an integral, using the Simpson's Rule of 1/3 method.

8. This program calculates an approximate solution of an integral, using the Romberg Integration method.

9. This program calculates an approximate solution of a differential equation, using Euler's method.

10. This program calculates an approximate solution of a differential equation, using the Runge-Kutta method.
